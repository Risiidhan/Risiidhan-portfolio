               As a Software Engineer I have demonstrated a strong ability
                to adapt quickly and learn independently, ensuring timely project completion
                and maintaining a steadfast commitment to excellence. My journey began with a
                role where I served to enhance website responsiveness and cross platform development
                and now I play a full stack role in the development of comprehensive projects.

                Education wise, I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from London

                as the top performer in my graduating batch, I have consistently demonstrated a
                strong aptitude for academic excellence and a passion for continuous learning.
